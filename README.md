This repository is part of the [nRF Connect SDK Intermediate](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-intermediate/) course by [Nordic Developer Academy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com).

The nRF Connect SDK Intermediate course is a self-paced, hands-on online course that is aimed at empowering developers to master advanced topics and techniques for developing applications using the nRF Connect SDK. The course is designed to enable developers with some experience in the nRF Connect SDK to take their skills to the next level.

The course covers a wide range of topics, including thread management, data passing, debugging applications, adding support for custom boards, interacting with the SPI, ADC, and PWM peripherals, device driver development, and secure Device Firmware Update (DFU/FOTA) over different transports. The skills and knowledge gained from this course are applicable to any of Nordic Semiconductor’s devices, including the nRF91, nRF70, nRF53, and nRF52 Series.
